# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves training agents to make sequences of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. The agent learns to make decisions by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The agent's goal is to maximize the total reward it receives over time.

## Key Concepts

### Agent

The agent is the entity that learns to make decisions in the environment. The agent interacts with the environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

### Environment

The environment is the external system that the agent interacts with. The environment provides feedback to the agent in the form of rewards or penalties based on the actions taken by the agent.

### State

The state is a representation of the environment at a given point in time. The state provides information about the current situation of the environment, which the agent can use to make decisions.

### Action

The action is a decision made by the agent to interact with the environment. The agent chooses actions based on the current state of the environment and the goal it is trying to achieve.
